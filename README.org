This is a simple Common Lisp xclip front-end that assumes you're using
SBCL on a Unix/Linux system.  trivial-clipboard is already good enough
for most purposes, but I found a need for this level of granular
control in some projects, hence the very trivial library.

I also like having a setf-able function as the clipboard interface.
